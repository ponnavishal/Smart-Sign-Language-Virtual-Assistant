# Smart-Sign-Language-Virtual-Assistant
This project is a deep learning–based Smart Sign Language Detection System that recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet signs (A–Z) in real time using a webcam. The system is designed to help bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public by converting hand gestures into readable text.
